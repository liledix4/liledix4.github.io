# liledix4.github.io

Brand new, proper personal website *(in private production)*

It's being created from scratch! I'm not using Quartz for it anymore (only for the standalone repositories if there's a need for it).

Therefore, it takes time! A hell lot of time! But it WILL worth it! You'll see.

But for now...

## Other pages

- [Commissions](./comm)
- [Notice about busyness](./busy)

## Where to find me?

You can follow my announcements there:

- [YouTube – @liledix4](https://www.youtube.com/@liledix4/community)
- [Twitter/X – @liledix4](https://twitter.com/liledix4)

Maybe you'll notice that SOMETHING'S COOKIN'!!!! And actually I'm reeeeeally excited!

## Discord

Also you can contact me on Discord! `liledix4` or `liledix4#2858` – ALL friend requests are accepted! Besides, **I never block anyone!** *(more like others can block me, and what for is beyond me)*

Alternatively, you can try [this link](https://discord.com/users/472184744814051330) but it's not guaranteed to work – because Discord devs are so weird that they can't make proper invite/direct links for a profile (not a server).
