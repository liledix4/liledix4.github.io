# liledix4.github.io
Brand new, proper personal website

It's being created from scratch! I'm not using Quartz for it anymore (only for the standalone repositories if there's a need for it).

Therefore, it takes time! A hell lot of time! But it WILL worth it! You'll see.

But for now, you can follow my announcements there:

Maybe you'll notice that SOMETHING'S COOKIN'!!!!
