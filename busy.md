### What is the main focus right now?

</summary>

There is a [GitHub project for all my projects](https://github.com/users/liledix4/projects/15). There you can keep track of the updates and priorities.

It's updated live, every time when some change happens.

### But I don't understand GitHub

</summary>

Unfortunately, I can't think of any better way to show my progress.

Here's what we could agree on. When you open the project I mentioned, **you don't need to understand details**.

Now, follow these very simple instructions:
1. [Open the project.](https://github.com/users/liledix4/projects/15)
2. Can you see that "Must be done" tab is opened? If it's true, good.
3. If you see ***any*** blocks in ***any*** columns – it means that I'm busy. Simple as that. A perfect indication that I'm free: **all columns should be empty!**
4. You don't need to read the blocks themselves. Most likely, you won't understand what they're about. But if you *want* to understand, [ask me personally!](./links)

### What about YouTube content and new music?

</summary>

**I'm not interested in fanmade music.**

My primary interest is original game series, for which I write scripts and ideas, make music, create web projects, and so on.

If fanmade music helps popularize this project or support it financially, I'll keep doing it. If not, I see no reasons to continue, because this is not my passion anymore. If you wonder why: fanmade music limits my overall creativity, and I'm not happy with that – I wish I was better known for the bigger things I have in mind, and I'll try my best to achieve it, just like I achieved with fanmade music in 2020 after some period of trial and error.

**Unless it's something significant that helps my project to shine:** I'm not listening to requests, I'm not accepting music collaborations, I'm not joining fanmade projects and any other projects. If commissions are open, you can do paid requests for fanmade music – in which case I don't mind working on it.

If it's something I can't monetize within weeks (especially when it comes to long-term fanmade projects where content needs to be kept secret for long periods of time) – big no. The project requires monetary investment, and I can't spend energy on music that doesn't help develop the project including financially.
