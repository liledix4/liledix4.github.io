# Commissions are CLOSED

*Latest update: **20 August 2024***

The only available way to commission me is through [**YouTube Membership**](https://www.youtube.com/@liledix4/membership) and **YouTube Super Thanks** (use it on *any* video, it counts as a commission).

> I'm fixing these ways of payment: Wise, DonationAlerts, Boosty, Visa Direct, Telegram (Tribute).

> There are special payment methods for some countries (particularly the one I live in and countries near it), but I don't mention them here. The info here is global.

If commissions are closed:
- Each previous commission is suspended â€“ work will be continued once the commissions are reopened.
- You can **pre-order** â€“ work will begin once the commissions are reopened.

## When will commissions open?

Expected time: September 2024.

First of all, I need to finish `0.1` version of website [bvsgame.github.io](https://bvsgame.github.io), to reintroduce the game project I'm working on: "Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers".

After that, I'll make some efforts to spread the project (I'll try to contact some other YouTube channels for help) and fund it through releases of new fanmade music on YouTube, accepting commissions, and paid web development. In addition, I'll be asking for feedback and ideas. This won't last long, it'll all close again to continue working on the next big wave of content for the game.

## Price list

This is only about music. I don't take any other types of commissions yet *(keep an eye on updates, other options may be available in the future)*.

### Re-remix

One of any tracks previously made by me â€“ they can be edited with the lower price.

| Price   | Max duration | Complexity |
| :------ | :----------- | :--------- |
| **$2**  | ðŸ•’ 3:00      | Any        |

### One track

It doesn't matter if it's fanmade or original.

| Price   | Max duration | Complexity              |
| :------ | :----------- | :---------------------- |
| **$5**  | ðŸ•‘ 2:00      | ðŸ”· Simple/uncomplicated |
| **$10** | ðŸ•– 7:00      | ðŸ”· Simple/uncomplicated |
| **$10** | ðŸ•œ 1:30      | ðŸ’  Complex              |
| **$20** | ðŸ•’ 3:00      | ðŸ’  Complex              |
| **$50** | ðŸ•– 7:00      | ðŸ’  Complex              |

### Mini-playlist

The difference is that the tracks may share the style or motifs. Logistically, you order several tracks at once, which is easier than several separate orders, and on top of that it helps me a lot to finance my projects.

| Price   | Max amount<br>of tracks | Max duration | Complexity |
| :------ | ----------------------: | :----------- | :--------- |
| **$20** |  5 | ðŸ•’ 3:00 | ðŸ”· Simple/uncomplicated |
| **$50** | 10 | ðŸ•’ 3:00 | ðŸ”· Simple/uncomplicated |
| **$50** |  5 | ðŸ•’ 3:00 | ðŸ’  Complex              |

## What you'll get

- Every WIP (work-in-progress) version of the track â€“ MP3 128 kbps
- Final version of the track â€“ MP3 320 kbps, FLAC, WAV, OGG
- You can request MIDI and stems if you like â€“ it's free
    - Project files won't be sent

## What style to expect

Short answer: **anything you may hear (or have already heard) from my content.** Ultimately, that's the only limitation, but I can go beyond that (in which case I'm entering the realm of experimentation, at your own risk).

Long answer:

Mood:

- Happy and upbeat
- Romantic
- Heroic
- Tragic

- Adventurous
- Atmospheric

Genres:

- Main genre is VGM (video game music), but it's not specific
- Rock
- Orchestral
- Pop
- Chiptune

- Synths (there are many types of them)
    - Also there are chiptune synths, including Sega Genesis synths
- Keyboard: pianos, organs, clavinets, harpsichords
- Drums: acoustic, orchestral and electronic
- Percussions: tambourines, shakers
- Guitars: acoustic and electric
- Orchestral, mainly: strings (violins, violas, cellos, double bass, harps), woodwinds (clarinets, flutes, oboes, bassoons), brass (trumpets, tubas, trombones)

- And more

Franchises (for fanmade music):

- Sonic the Hedgehog
- *It doesn't mean that I can't do something else, like Touhou, Undertale, Genshin Impact, or XCOM*

## How payments work

If commissions haven't been completed, the payments have **an accumulative effect**.

If you paid $5 four times, you can request a $20 commission instead of four $5 commissions.

There's no difference if you paid using one-time donations (like YouTube Super Thanks) multiple times or if you paid for 4 months of $5 subscription (like YouTube Membership) â€“ all of these can convert to $20 commission.

So, even $50 commission is accessible if you pay piece by piece! ðŸ™ƒ

## Terms

- Unfortunately, there are no refunds possible. The nature of YouTube donations doesn't allow refunding. I'm really sorry. Well, you could try to contact YouTube or Google, but their support teams are quite questionable to say the least.
- You can choose whether the commissioned tracks will be uploaded to my YouTube channel or not. Unless it's specified, I don't upload on my own.
- Even if some tracks are presumably original, they're not allowed for commercial use. Especially when it comes to the fanmade music. I'm not providing any kind of licensing, and I'm not helping to deal with copyright. Still, for fanmade projects and indie projects, it's perfectly fine!
- Recreations, remixes and remasters are allowed! Go for it!
- Giving a credit is welcome (it's really nice), but it's not a requirement.
